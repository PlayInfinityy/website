A broke, desperate online 'eboy' who can't even scrape together enough for a Rust account or a basic VPN subscription. Relies on others' money like a leech, living in a constant state of cowardice and entitlement."

        description: "She threw away someone who had their life together, who was ready to give her everything, just to chase after a fucking eboy. Walked away from stability, loyalty, and real love, all for the attention of some immature, attention-seeking loser who offered her nothing but empty promises and drama. She chose chaos over comfort, and now she's stuck with the mess she made."
